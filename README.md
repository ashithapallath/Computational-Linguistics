# Computational-Linguistics
This repository applies computational techniques to process and analyze natural language. It includes functions for tokenization, spelling correction, and bigram probability calculation to improve text accuracy and meaning. The program identifies misspelled words, suggests corrections, and evaluates sentence structure based on language models.
